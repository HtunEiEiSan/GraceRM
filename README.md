Title: Spotify Data Analysis Using only Excel
This is my first project on GIT. I am really excited to share with y'all that I analyzed Spotify Dataset using Excel only. 
To create a README file for the music listening analysis to post on GitHub, follow this structure:

Overview:
This repository contains the analysis of music listening data to uncover trends and insights into listener preferences. The analysis utilizes a dataset of Spotify streaming data to explore various aspects of music consumption, including listener preferences, artist popularity, and the impact of music attributes on listener engagement.

Data:
The dataset used for this analysis is a collection of Spotify streaming data, including information about tracks, artists, and listener behavior. The data includes attributes such as danceability, energy, valence, stream count, and playlist inclusion.

Analysis:
The analysis involves various techniques, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and correlations between music attributes, listener preferences, and artist popularity.

Key Findings:
Listeners tend to prefer upbeat, energetic tracks with a positive mood.
Danceability shows a positive correlation with stream count, suggesting that danceable tracks attract more listeners.
Playlist inclusion and chart presence significantly impact music popularity.
Artists like The Weeknd, Taylor Swift, and Bad Bunny dominate streaming platforms.

Implications:
Artists can create music that aligns with listener preferences to increase engagement.
Music curators can prioritize upbeat, danceable tracks with positive moods.
Playlist inclusion and chart presence can be leveraged to boost artist visibility.

Future Work:
Analyze additional music attributes to gain deeper insights into listener preferences.
Explore genre-specific trends and identify patterns within different music genres.
Investigate the impact of social media and influencer marketing on music popularity.

This analysis is open to contribute and feel free to fork the repository, suggest improvements, and share your findings.
